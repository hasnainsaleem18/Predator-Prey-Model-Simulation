# Predator-Prey-Model-Simulation
Implemented in Python, this project simulates the dynamic interaction between hawks (predators) and squirrels (prey) using the Euler method. It tracks the population changes of both species over time, reflecting their growth rates and interactions, to explore the ecological dynamics of predator-prey relationships.
